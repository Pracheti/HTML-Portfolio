<h1> The Best Movies According to Pracheti </h1>

<h2> My top 3 Movies of all time </h2>

<hr/>

<h3> Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara </h3>
<p> Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, through the lives of three friends, presents the world of contemporary Indian youth, who are successful, affluent yuppies. They just enjoy life because financially they have the means to do it. In mood and execution the film is very modern, light, yet it entails complex relationships in family and between friends. </p>

<h3> 3 Idiots </h3>
<p> Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them "idiots". </p>

<h3> Dangal </h3>
<p> A sports biopic, Dangal totally justifies the real life story of Haryana wrestler who trained his older two daughters in the art of wrestling and turned them into champions. The film delivers a very important message with such sincerity that it just doesn’t overwhelm the storytelling. 
    Messages on our obsession with the male child, bigoted stand on bringing up our daughters and the administration’s wretched attitude towards sports, are loud and clear.  </p>
